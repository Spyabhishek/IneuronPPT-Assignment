Q.7 Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript?

Ans - The async and await keywords are part of the ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) update to JavaScript. They provide a syntactical sugar on top of Promises and offer a more concise and readable way to write asynchronous code.

async:
The 'async' keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. It allows the function to use the await keyword inside its body to pause the execution until a Promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Ex - async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

await:
The 'await' keyword can only be used inside an async function. It is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. When used with a Promise, it waits for the Promise to settle and then returns the fulfilled value.

Ex - async function fetchAndProcessData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log("Fetched data:", data);
    // Perform further operations
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error occurred:", error);
  }
}
