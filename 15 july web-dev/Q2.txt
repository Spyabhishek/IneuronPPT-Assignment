Q.2 Explain useState Hook & what can you achieve with it?
Ans - 
The useState hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It provides a way to store and update state within a functional component, which was previously only possible in class components.

The useState hook takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state value. By calling this update function, React re-renders the component with the new state value.

we can achieve:
1. Declaring and managing state.
2. Updating state.
3. Functional updates.


Ex - 
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
