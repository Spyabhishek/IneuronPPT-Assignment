Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.

Ans - Breakpoints are used in conjunction with media queries to define different sets of CSS rules that apply at different device widths.

Ex - 
 CSS rules for devices with a maximum width of 600px 
 
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
 
}

 CSS rules for devices with a minimum width of 601px and a maximum width of 1024px 

@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {

}

 CSS rules for devices with a minimum width of 1025px

@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  
}
