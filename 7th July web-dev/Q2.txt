Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Ans - To define a media query in CSS, you use the ' @media 'rule followed by a specific condition or set of conditions within parentheses.
Ex - @media media-type and (condition) {
  /* CSS rules specific to the media query */
}

Like devices with a maximum screen width of 600 pixels :
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {

}
