Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

Ans. 

Absolute: The position of the element will be relative to the closest positioned ancestor.

Relative: The element remains in the normal flow of the document but left, right, top, and bottom affects.

Sticky: The element with position: sticky and top: 0 played a role between fixed & relative based on the position where it is placed.

Fixed: The position of the element will be positioned relative to the viewport.

Example - 

.fixed-example {
    border: 2px solid greenyellow;
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
}

.sticky-example {
    border: 2px solid green;
    position: sticky;
    top: 50px;
}

.relative-example {
    border: 2px solid yellow;
    position: relative;
    top: 30px;
    left: 50px;
}

.absolute-example {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
