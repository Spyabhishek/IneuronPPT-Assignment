Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

Ans: 

HTML Tag:
An HTML tag represents an element or a structure within an HTML document. It consists of the tag name enclosed in angle brackets ("<" and ">"). Tags define the purpose and behavior of elements on a webpage. Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <a>, <img>, etc.
Ex: 
<div>This is a div tag.</div>
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>

HTML Attribute:
HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. They are used to specify various properties such as the source of an image, the URL of a link, the width of an element, and more. Each HTML element may have different attributes associated with it.
Ex:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
<a href="https://google.co.in">Link</a>


Global Attributes:
Global attributes are a set of attributes that can be used with any HTML element, regardless of its type. These attributes provide common functionalities and apply to multiple elements.
Ex:
class, div, style, src.
