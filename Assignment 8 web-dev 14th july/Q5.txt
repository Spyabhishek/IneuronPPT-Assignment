Q.5 Difference between class & function based component.

Ans -

Class Component : 
- A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.

- It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is syntactically similar to HTML)

- The class component is instantiated and different life cycle method is kept alive and is run and invoked depending on the phase of the class component.

- Constructor is used as it needs to store state. 

Functional Component : 
- A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).

- There is no render method used in functional components.

- Functional component run from top to bottom and once the function is returned it canâ€™t be kept alive.

- Constructors are not used.
