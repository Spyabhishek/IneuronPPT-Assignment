Q.6 Explain react component life cycle .

Ans - React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the componentâ€™s existence.

It go through 4 stages :

- Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.

- Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.

- Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.

- Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page.
