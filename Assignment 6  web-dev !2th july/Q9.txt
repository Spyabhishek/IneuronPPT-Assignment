Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

Ans - In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and methods. It is a template or a constructor for creating multiple instances of objects with similar characteristics.

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("John", 25);

person1.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John and I'm 25 years old."
