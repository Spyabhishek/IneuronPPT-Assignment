Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Ans - Abstraction involves the concept of representing essential features and behavior of real-world objects in a simplified manner. It focuses on the 'what' rather than the 'how'. Abstraction allows developers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define the common structure and behavior of a group of objects, without specifying the implementation details.
