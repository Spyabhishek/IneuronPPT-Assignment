Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?

Ans - 

In JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent or superclass. It is often used within the context of a subclass constructor to invoke the constructor of the parent class and access its properties and methods.

The main purpose of the 'super' keyword is to enable and control inheritance in JavaScript. It allows a subclass to inherit behavior from its superclass while providing the flexibility to override or extend that behavior.

class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    super.speak(); // Call the parent method
    console.log("The dog barks.");
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
myDog.speak();
// Output:
// "The animal makes a sound."
// "The dog barks."
