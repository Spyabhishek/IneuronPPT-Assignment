Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?

Ans - Template literals provide an enhanced way to work with strings in JavaScript. They allow for easy string interpolation and multiline strings. Template literals are enclosed by backticks (` `) instead of single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").

Ex - 
const name = "Alice";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
